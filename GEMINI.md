# Gemini CLI Project Constitution

## Project Overview
A Python script that uses the `turtle` library to draw pixel art based on a 2D data array.

## Core Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `turtle`

## Style and Conventions
- The core art is defined in a 2D list called `turtle_data`.
- `0` represents a transparent pixel.
- Numbers 1-3 map to specific colors (greens, brown).
- The script should be runnable as a standalone file.

## Execution
- **Run the script:** `python turtle_pixel_art.py`
